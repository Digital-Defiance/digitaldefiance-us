# Digital Defiance: United States Chapter

Welcome to the United States Chapter of Digital Defiance, a non-profit organization registered under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, based in Washington State.

## Empowering Open Source Contributors with the necessary mentorship and support to thrive in team environments and various tech-centric workplaces, whether in software development or embedded electronics domains.

## Our Chapter

As the inaugural and, at present, the sole chapter of Digital Defiance, we are the pioneers in a global movement of engineers committed to public service. While we are proudly based in the United States, our vision is truly international. We foresee the establishment of additional chapters around the world in the future, including an EU Chapter, among others.

## Our Mission

Our Chapter is committed to the shared mission that forms the backbone of Digital Defiance:

> "The mission of Digital Defiance, a non-profit organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, is to foster an inclusive community of engineers committed to educating, mentoring, and collaboratively working on projects that serve the public interest and advance the frontiers of science and useful arts. By embracing the free exchange of ideas and civil discourse, we aspire to strengthen our democratic principles as highlighted in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution. Furthermore, our organization is dedicated to promoting a civil society through the creation and enhancement of software and hardware that aid in upholding the rule of law in the physical world."

Each subsequent chapter, as it becomes a part of Digital Defiance, will uphold this mission, ensuring unity in our global efforts. However, membership management and tracking may vary from chapter to chapter due to jurisdictional differences.

## Membership and Voting

Currently, all Digital Defiance members, regardless of their geographical location, are accounted for under the United States Chapter and participate in voting within this chapter. As we establish new chapters, members will cast their votes within their respective organizations, reinforcing our commitment to democratic principles across our expanding community.

We invite you to join us on this exciting journey of fostering an open, transparent culture of open source development. Together, we can empower the open-source community and contribute to creating a more connected and equitable digital world.
