# Digital Defiance, United States Chapter

The Digital Defiance, United States Chapter is a 501c3 incorporated in Washington State as Digital Defiance.

At the present time, Digital Defiance is only comprised of one chapter, but in the future the possibility is open for an EU Chapter or other chapters. See [DigitalDefiance.org](https://digitaldefiance.org) for more information on Digital Defiance and its mission.

The United States Chapter subscribes to the same mission as the Digital Defiance organization as a whole, as must each other chapter, however there may be jurisdictional differences in how membership is accounted for and tracked. Members shall vote within their organization.

At present all members vote under the United States Chapter even if they are not members of that country as there is only one chapter.
